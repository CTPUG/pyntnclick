#. Pry it open with the femur.
#. Escape into the hallway.

Clearing the overgrowth
-----------------------

#. In the Mess, there's a big overgrown broccoli.
#. Use the grinder in the Machine Room to sharpen your femur into a
   machete.
#. Cut through the growth, revealing broken pipes.

Getting into the Engine Room
----------------------------

#. Pick up the stethoscope from the doctor's body on the Bridge.
#. There's a locked safe in the Crew Quarters, using the stethoscope,
   you can open it.
#. Pick up the duct tape.

   seal the joints with duct tape.
#. The environmental system is now working.

Repairing the superconductor
----------------------------

#. There is a broken superconductor in the Engine Room.
#. Get the manual from the corpse in the Machine Room.

   superconductor.

   one.

Cooling the superconductor
