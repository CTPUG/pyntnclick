A walk-through to assist PyWeek judges and anyone else with severe time
constraints.

Escaping Cryo Room

#. Grab the Titanium femur from the body in the second right-most
   cryo-chamber.

Clearing the overgrowth
-----------------------

   machete.
#. Cut through the growth, revealing broken pipes.

Getting into the Engine Room
----------------------------

#. Pick up the stethoscope from the doctor's body on the Bridge.
#. There's a locked safe in the Crew Quarters, using the stethoscope,
   you can open it.
#. Pick up the duct tape.

   Room.

Fixing the broken pipes
-----------------------

#. Collect the can opener from the corpse in the Engine Room.
#. Collect all 3 cans from the Mess, and open them.
#. Use the machete on the two middle cryo-pipes in the Cryo Chamber to
   cut out 3 cryo-pipe sections (the right hand pipe will yield two
   sections.
#. Place an open can and a pipe segment into the laser welder in the
   Machine Room, and hit the power button. It will combine them into a
   fixed pipes item in your inventory. Repeat twice.
#. Attach the fixed pipe section to the broken pipes in the mess.
#. Duct tape to seal the joins.
#. The environmental system is now working.

Repairing the superconductor

Disabling JIM
