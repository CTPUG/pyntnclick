Pyntnclick
==========

pyntnclick is a library for building point and click adventure games using Python and PyGame.

Originally part of our PyWeek 11 entry, [Suspended Sentence](https://pyweek.org/e/boomslang/),
this has been split out to be a more general purpose library.

A version of Suspended Sentence that uses pyntnclick is available as an example
from [github](https://github.com/CTPUG/suspended_sentence).
